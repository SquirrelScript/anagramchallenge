#Anagram Challenge

Create an anagram checker that takes a string and checks against against another string to see if they are an anagram of each other.  So "robert" and "Trebor" will return anagram, "trebor" and "roberts" will return not an anagram.  You will need to work out how a user can input the strings and view the result in the command line.

##Stretch challenges

Create a GUI and/or some tests, either unit or end to end.  

Upload your code to Github and work with another member of the group to allow them to download your repo and improve your code on their computer.  Load the changes back up to github and then visit the new code base on your computer
